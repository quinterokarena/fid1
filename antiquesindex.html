<h2>Our History</h2>
<p>During some of my hardest years in college, I realized one of my true passions in life was to bring back points and pieces of our lives that seemed to stop in time. Items of our childhood and adolescence that you could look at once, and bring you to a place that no one else could feel except yourself. I started this small shop in Central Florida in 2018, after I graduated at Seminole State College with my AA in Interactive Design. I wanted to create a space where anyone, whether they were 13 or 87, could be reminded of a special time or place in their memories. I started with a record collection, since they gained popularity again in the 2010's, but I knew that there was so much more I wanted to share with my community. I began collecting from small flea markets and garage sales, the best pieces I could find. Until It all came to this. I welcome you to my place, which is also yours, to feel nostalgia in the best way possible. I hope you enjoy your visit!</p>
