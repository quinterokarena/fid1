<h1>Low and Slow</h1>
	<p>This week I am <i>extremely</i> excited about a new cooking technique called <i>sous vide.</i> In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <i>Cooking for Geeks,</i> Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>

<p>Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise.</b> To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>
